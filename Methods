* Methods are portions of a larger program that perform specific tasks. They are great for organizing code and for error prevention
They can also be used in more than one place allowing you to reuse previous code.

They are very similar to 'functions' or 'components' in javascript.



using System;

public class Methods
{
  public static void Main()
  {
    int x = 2;
    int y = 2;
    int a = foo(x,y); // foo is not yet defined in the main method, 'a' will not be written until 'foo' is defined
    Console.WriteLine(a);
  }

  public static int foo (int x, int y)
  {
    return ( x / y );
  } //now that the foo method is defined, a will render and '1' will write to the console.


}
