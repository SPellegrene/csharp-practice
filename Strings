Very similiar syntax to that of Javascript

using System;
public class StringPractice
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        string firstName = "Sam";
        string lastName = "Pellegrene";
        int age = 22;

        string sentence = firstName + " " + lastName + " is " + age + " years old.";

        Console.WriteLine(sentence); //Sam Pellegrene is 22 years old

    }
}
